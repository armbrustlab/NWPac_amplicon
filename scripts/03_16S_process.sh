# 03_16S_process.sh

# a shell script for processing the NWPac 16S amplicon data
# Jamie Collins, Armbrust Lab, University of Washington; james.r.collins@aya.yale.edu
# some of this is based on the script "16Smothurpipeline_v2.sh" by Rachelle Lim (formerly in Armbrust Lab)
# ... and a lot of @rachellelim's pipeline was based on the directions here: https://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP

# inputs to this script: raw amplicon sequence files; some file paths in the variables section below
# outputs: OTU abundance information for input into phyloseq R analyses

# assumes:
# 1. we've already run scripts to provision a machine (if necessary) and install necessary dependencies, including mothur, 
# boost, boost-python, and rclone (perhaps with the scripts "01_vagrant_provision_ubuntu.sh" and "02_metagenomics_amplicon_provision.sh")
# 2. mothur is already be added to the path
# 3. scripts is also be added to the path

# some basic formatting directions, so that this all works correctly:
# 1. filename format (from sequencer) should be:
# PRIMER-SAMPLENAME_BARCODE_R1.fastq (e.g., V4_515F_New_V4_806R_New-64039_ATTAGCGAGT_R2.fastq)
# 2. all 16S files should begin with "V4_515F_New_V4," but can be stored in any directories or subdirectories so long as complementary 
# forward and reverse reads are stored together
# 3. the file paths between the primary fastq data directory (whatever you specify for "file_dir", below) and the locations of your
# fastq files should contain no spaces or special characters other than underscores
